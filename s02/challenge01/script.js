Coding challenge #01

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) 

(mass in kg and height in meter)

Your tasks:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:

- Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
- Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
*/

// Data 1
// const weightMark = 78;
// const heightMark = 1.69;
// const weightJohn = 92;
// const heightJohn = 1.95;

// Data 2
const weightMark = 95;
const heightMark = 1.88;
const weightJohn = 85;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const bmiMark = weightMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const bmiJohn = weightJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

console.log("Mark's BMI: " + bmiMark);
console.log("John's BMI: " + bmiJohn);

const markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;
console.log("Is Mark's BMI greater than John's BMI? " + markHigherBMI);
